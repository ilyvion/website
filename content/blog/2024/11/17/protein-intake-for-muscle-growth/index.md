Since starting my health and weight loss journey this time around, I've been watching a lot of Dr. Mike Israetel's [Renaissance Periodization YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RenaissancePeriodization). His advice is mainly for body building and hypertrophy, and while I'm currently working out for strength and not hypertrophy, that might change some day. Regardless, I think it's good to learn about good technique, nutrition, and general exercise science from qualified people, among whom Dr. Mike ranks highly.

I feel that some of these videos contain such fundamental and important knowledge that they need to be made even more accessible. Not everybody has 15–30 minutes to spare for watching every video of his[^special-interest], and since I enjoy taking notes[^taking-notes] when I watch things I intend to apply to my life, I might as well share those notes with y'all.

I will definitely not be doing this to each of his videos. For one, it'd be straight up plagiarism at that point, but also, not all the videos feel as important (to me) to get out there as the ones I will pick out.

#### Summary

1. **Daily protein intake**:

   - Aim for roughly <Measurement>1 g/lbs</Measurement> of body weight per day to maximize muscle growth and prevent muscle wasting.

2. **Meal frequency and distribution**:

   - To maximize anabolism, consume four evenly spaced, high-protein meals per day. Over four meals (e.g., five or six) generally do not provide additional muscle growth benefits.
   - Thus, divide your daily protein goal across four meals. Some examples given various body weights:
     - <Measurement>100 lbs</Measurement> individual: ~<Measurement>25 g</Measurement> of protein per meal.
     - <Measurement>150 lbs</Measurement> individual: ~<Measurement>37.5 g</Measurement> per meal.
     - <Measurement>200 lbs</Measurement> individual: ~<Measurement>50 g</Measurement> per meal.
     - <Measurement>250 lbs</Measurement> individual: ~<Measurement>62.5 g</Measurement> per meal.

3. **Minimum protein intake**:

   - Half the ideal protein per meal is sufficient for basic muscle maintenance. Some examples given various body weights:
     - <Measurement>100 lbs</Measurement> individual: ~<Measurement>12.5 g</Measurement> per meal.
     - <Measurement>150 lbs</Measurement> individual: ~<Measurement>19 g</Measurement> per meal.
     - <Measurement>200 lbs</Measurement> individual: ~<Measurement>25 g</Measurement> per meal.

4. **Protein absorption research**:

   - Studies on whey protein show 25 g per meal as a maximum for muscle protein synthesis. However, real meals (containing fats and carbs) allow for slower digestion and higher protein utilization.
   - Resistance training increases sensitivity to protein, allowing trained individuals to use more protein effectively.

5. **Compensatory effects**:

   - If you consume less protein in one meal, you can partially compensate by eating more protein in subsequent meals. This is less effective if protein intake is consistently low across an entire day—i.e., you can't compensate for a whole low protein day with a subsequent extra high protein day.

6. **Exceeding maximums**:

   - Eating more protein than the maximum usable amount per meal is not harmful. Excess protein supports other bodily functions or is used for energy, with minimal impact on fat gain.

7. **Relation to carbohydrates and fats**:

   - Protein requirements for muscle growth need to be balanced with sufficient carbohydrate and fat intake to support energy, recovery, and hormonal health.
   - Excessive protein at the expense of carbs or fats can hinder performance and overall muscle-building potential.

8. **Nuances**:

   - Normal dietary patterns (e.g., low-protein meals like sandwiches with a single turkey slice) are inadequate for optimal muscle growth.
   - Thus, individuals aiming for muscle growth need to plan their meals intentionally to include adequate protein.

#### Summa summarum[^latin]

For optimal muscle growth: eat four meals daily, each with ~<Measurement>1 g/lbs</Measurement> body weight, balance macros, and be consistent.

[^special-interest]: Go special interest hyper-focus, woo! I haven't yet written about my neurodivergence in the blog, but it's brewing somewhere in my head, and I will go into more detail about it at a later date.

[^taking-notes]: I don't actually enjoy taking notes where I can't pause the stream of information, such as in lectures or in meetings. I can either pay attention to the information or I can take notes, but I can't do both. My experience is thus that if I'm taking notes, they end up being bad notes, and I've also not really picked up on the information presented. When watching videos on YouTube, e.g., though, I can digest some information, pause the video, and then write the information down, which works wonderfully.

[^latin]: Latin for "sum-of-sums," used in this case to mean "to sum up the summary" because I'm a shameless, pretentious word snob.
