When I first started this blog, I had originally intended to have a rough schedule of averaging one blog post per week. The intention behind it was that being forced to write about _something_ every week would develop my writing skills, and that maybe one day it would become natural for me to write every week, instead of a forced chore. As you can easily see, I did not actually set this schedule up for myself, and consequently, there hasn't been a post made on the blog since late June.

That changes today. Starting now, week 39 of 2020, I'm making it a goal to post one article on my blog every week.
